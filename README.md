# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview
Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, one of your most important clients. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. Martha knows that the popularity of bitcoin has caused a price jump that makes it unaffordable for many new investors. However, there are many many more cryptocurrencies available at more affordable prices. Martha has a data set of cryptocurrencies. The data is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, she wants to use unsupervised learning.  Unsupervised learning is used to process data, cluster, reduce dimensions, and reduce the principal components using PCA. Martha wants to create an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. A Clustering algorithm will be used to group the cryptocurrencies.
